# WTF
Web pages to help work with KiCAD 6. Main idea create somthing simple, to fast transport from datasheet table to KiCAD symbol with compatible to RUS GOST. 

No need install apache/nginx and other stuff. Just download and use.

Start from index.html and choose tools.

# List of tools
 * Group pin by name or info
 * Connector symbol 
 * Module symbol generator (very similar to connector)
 * IC generator (under construction)
