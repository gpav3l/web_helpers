# WTF
Web pages to help work with KiCAD6, Verilog test bench and other future stuff. 

Result can be copy, or saved as file.

## KiCAD6 helpers
  Main idea create somthing simple, to fast transport from datasheet table to KiCAD symbol with compatible to RUS GOST. 
 
 * Group pin by name or info
 * Connector symbol 
 * Module symbol generator (very similar to connector)
 * IC generator

## Verilog test bench
  Generate test bench template by module port description. Support parsing parameters. Create wires and regs, module description with test signal connection, empty initial blog. Like do ISE of Xilinx.
  
   * Vivado test bench generation for module (like in ISE)

# Install

No need install apache/nginx and other additional stuff for Yourself usage. Just download and use.

Start from index.html, choose tools.
